		<h1>Metallica</h1>
		<h2>Fade To Black</h2>
		<p>Life, it seems, will fade away<br>
		Drifting further every day<br>
		Getting lost within myself<br>
		Nothing matters, no one else</p>
		<p>I have lost the will to live<br>
		Simply nothing more to give<br>
		There is nothing more for me<br>
		Need the end to set me free</p>
		<p>Things not what they used to be</br>
		Missing one inside of me</br>
		Deathly lost, this can't be real<br>
		Cannot stand this hell I feel</p>
		<p>Emptiness is filling me<br>
		To the point of agony<br>
		Growing darkness taking dawn<br>
		I was me, but now he's gone</p>
		<p>No one but me can save myself, but it's too late<br>
		Now I can't think, think why I should even try</p>
		<p>Yesterday seems as though it never existed<br>
		Death greets me warm<br>
		Now I will just say goodbye</p>
